GOAL
Create a customer Billing Center page in the WORKSPACE app and a minimal backend skeleton to support Stripe later. No card required trial. Billing Center must show plan, trial countdown, invoices list (mock), and a “Manage Billing” button (Stripe Portal-ready).

HARD RULES
- Do not implement real Stripe payments yet unless Stripe is already installed.
- Keep current design system.
- Keep theme + language toggles working and translate ALL new UI strings.
- No HR features. No “tenant” wording.

WHERE TO BUILD
- Workspace app: apps/workspace-web
- Backend: server/
- Admin console: no changes in this section

FEATURES TO ADD

1) ROUTES / NAV
- Add route: /billing (or /settings/billing if that’s how your nav is structured)
- Add a “Billing” nav item under Settings (or in main nav if you prefer)
- Ensure only logged-in workspace users can access Billing

2) BILLING CENTER UI
Show cards/sections:

A) Current Plan
- Plan name: Trial / Starter / Pro / Enterprise
- Status: Trial / Active / Past due / Canceled
- Trial countdown if in trial:
  - “X days left in your trial”
  - trial end date (date formatting)
- After trial ends behavior (UI only for now):
  - “Your account will switch to Starter (free) with limits.”

B) Usage (minimal)
- Employees count
- Training records count
- Certificates generated count
(Keep it minimal; no extra analytics)

C) Upgrade
- Button: “Upgrade Plan”
- This routes to a simple /pricing (or opens a modal) with plan selection UI.
- Clicking a paid plan should call a placeholder function that would later create Stripe Checkout.

D) Invoices (mock)
- Show a small table: invoice date, amount, status, link button (fake)
- Use mock data for now.

E) Manage Billing (Stripe Portal-ready)
- Button: “Manage Billing”
- When clicked, call backend endpoint:
  POST /api/billing/portal
  Body: { returnUrl: window.location.origin + "/billing" }
- Backend returns { url }
- Frontend redirects to url
For now, backend can return a placeholder URL or “not configured” message if STRIPE is missing.

3) BACKEND SKELETON (Render-ready)
Create endpoints (even if mock):

GET /api/billing/summary
Returns:
{
  plan,
  billingStatus,
  trialEndsAt,
  employeesCount,
  trainingRecordsCount,
  certificatesCount,
  invoices:[...]
}

POST /api/billing/portal
- If Stripe env not present: return 501 with a clean message
- If present later: create Stripe customer portal session

Add env placeholders to server/.env.example:
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
- APP_URL=https://app.safetysync.ai

DONE CHECK
- Billing page shows correct trial countdown and plan info
- “Manage Billing” gracefully handles missing Stripe (friendly message)
- All new strings translate to ES-MX with no leftover English
OUTPUT
- List files changed/added
- How to test: create account -> dashboard banner -> billing page
