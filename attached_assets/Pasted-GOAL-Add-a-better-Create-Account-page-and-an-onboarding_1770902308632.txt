GOAL
Add a better “Create Account” page and an onboarding wizard to the WORKSPACE app. No card required. Starting an account creates an organization + admin user and starts a trial immediately.

HARD RULES
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Keep current design system/components.
- Keep dark/light toggle and EN ⇄ Español (México) language toggle working and translate all new UI strings.
- Do NOT mention HR features or HR managers.
- Do NOT use the word “tenant”. Use “organization” or “company account”.

WHERE TO BUILD
- Workspace app only: apps/workspace-web (or your current workspace frontend folder)
- Backend: server/ only as needed for minimal endpoints
- Shared types can go in shared/ if you already have it.

FEATURES TO ADD

1) ROUTES / PAGES
- Add route: /create-account
- Add route: /onboarding (wizard)
- Update /login page to include a link/button: “Create account”

2) CREATE ACCOUNT PAGE (UI)
Form fields:
- Organization name (required)
- Admin full name (required)
- Admin email (required)
- Password (required)
- Country (default United States) + State (optional for now)
- Phone (optional)

Behavior:
- Submit creates account and immediately signs user in (or stores a “session” like you do now).
- After success, redirect to /onboarding

Validation:
- Basic client validation (required fields, email format, min password length)

Copy requirements:
- Keep language simple. Spanish (Mexico) should be very simple and clear.

3) TRIAL LOGIC (no payment)
On account creation:
- trial_end_date = now + 14 days
- plan = "trial"
- billing_status = "trial"
Store these values in the org record (mock DB or real DB depending on what exists).

4) ONBOARDING WIZARD (3 steps, skippable)
Route: /onboarding
Step 1: “Add your first employees”
- simple employee add (name/title) + optional CSV upload placeholder
- button: Skip

Step 2: “Upload your first training document”
- links to Documents upload screen OR embed a simple upload panel
- button: Skip

Step 3: “Finish setup”
- shows: trial end date + next steps
- button: “Go to Dashboard”

Wizard requirements:
- progress indicator (Step 1/2/3)
- all steps translated (EN + ES-MX)
- store onboarding_completed = true when finished

DONE CHECK
- /create-account works end-to-end and routes to /onboarding
- Trial dates appear somewhere (on onboarding finish + dashboard banner placeholder)
- New UI strings are fully translated with language toggle
- No console errors
OUTPUT
- List files changed/added
- How to test: create account -> onboarding -> dashboard
