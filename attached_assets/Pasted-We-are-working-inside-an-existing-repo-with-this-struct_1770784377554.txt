We are working inside an existing repo with this structure:

- client/src/App.tsx uses wouter routing
- existing pages: client/src/pages/landing.tsx, login.tsx, dashboard.tsx, employees.tsx
- UI components exist under client/src/components/ui/*
- Tailwind is configured with darkMode: ["class"]

TASK: Extend the CURRENT app (do not create a separate /v2 folder) to become a clickable “V2 prototype” while keeping the current design language/components.

HARD RULES
- Do NOT delete or rewrite the app from scratch.
- Do NOT change routing library (keep wouter).
- No HR features or HR wording.
- Never use the word “tenant” anywhere. Use “organization” or “company account”.
- Add dark/light theme toggle (default dark).
- Add language toggle EN ⇄ Español (México).
  - When Spanish selected, ALL UI text across ALL pages must be Spanish (México).
  - Spanish must be simple like a 10-year-old can understand, but still natural Mexico Spanish.
  - No leftover English strings anywhere (buttons, labels, empty states, modals, toasts).
- Only key analytics (minimal): Employees, Training Records, Certificates, Expiring Soon.
- Add branding: “Powered by: SyncAi” in the header and in the footer (subtle, consistent with current design).

STEP 1 — Global Theme + Language (must be done first)
1) Create:
   - client/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx (or /contexts/theme.tsx)
   - client/src/contexts/I18nContext.tsx (dictionary-based translations, no heavy libraries)
2) Store theme + language in localStorage.
3) Apply theme by toggling the “dark” class on <html>.
4) Add Theme toggle + Language toggle in a shared top nav component (create if needed):
   - client/src/components/TopNav.tsx (or similar)
5) Ensure Landing, Login, Dashboard, Employees already use translated strings from the i18n dictionary.

STEP 2 — Organization selector (no “tenant”)
Add a simple organization selector in the top nav:
- “Organization” dropdown with at least:
  - Demo Construction Co.
  - Demo Industrial Co.
Store active organization in context (OrganizationContext) and filter mock data by it.

STEP 3 — Mock DB + Mock API (async)
Create:
- client/src/mock/db.ts with seed data:
  - organizations (2)
  - employees (10–12 split across orgs)
  - documents (6–10 with statuses: Processing, Needs Review, Approved, Rejected)
  - trainingRecords
  - certificates
  - walletCards
  - supportTickets (owner page)
- client/src/mock/api.ts with async functions using setTimeout delay:
  getOrganizations(), setActiveOrganization()
  listEmployees(orgId), getEmployee(id), createEmployee(orgId,payload), updateEmployee(id,payload)
  listDocuments(orgId), uploadDocument(orgId,fileMeta), getDocument(id)
  reviewDocument(id, edits)
  approveDocument(id) -> creates trainingRecords + certificates + walletCards
  rejectDocument(id, reason)
  listCertificates(orgId), createCertificate(payload)
  listWalletCards(orgId), createWalletCard(payload)
  listSupportTickets(), updateTicketStatus(id,status), addTicketNote(id,note)

STEP 4 — Expand routes (keep wouter)
Update client/src/App.tsx Router to add these routes:

Public:
- / (landing)
- /login
- /features
- /pricing
- /demo
- /security

App:
- /dashboard (existing)
- /employees (existing)
- /employees/:id (new employee profile)
- /documents (new)
- /certificates (new)
- /wallet-cards (new)
- /compliance (new)
- /settings (new)

Owner Admin:
- /owner/dashboard (new)
- /owner/support (new)

Do not break existing routes.

STEP 5 — Implement pages with current design system

A) Dashboard (key analytics only)
Update dashboard.tsx to show ONLY:
- Employees
- Training Records
- Certificates Generated
- Expiring Soon (next 30 days)
Also:
- Compliance Status: “Good” or “Needs Attention” (based on expiringSoon > 0)
- Recent activity list (mock)

B) Employees
- employees.tsx remains list page with table + Add Employee modal.
- Create employee profile page:
  client/src/pages/employee-profile.tsx (or pages/employees/[id].tsx style, but keep it simple)
  Sections:
    - Training history (table)
    - Certificates (list, fake download button)
    - Wallet cards (list, fake download button)
  Actions:
    - Add Training Record modal
    - Generate Certificate wizard modal (creates mock entry)
    - Generate Wallet Card wizard modal (creates mock entry)
  Wallet card UI MUST show:
    - training date
    - expiration date (field must exist and display)
    - preview block styled like 480x280 card

C) Documents (AI ingestion prototype)
Create documents page:
- Upload box (drag-drop UI, mock)
- Document list with status badges
- Clicking a Needs Review doc opens review panel/modal:
  editable fields:
    course name
    completion date
    instructor name
    OSHA standard (free text)
    trainee list (multi-select employees in current org)
  Buttons:
    Approve -> approveDocument() creates records + certs + wallet cards and updates:
      - dashboard counts
      - employee profile lists
      - document status
    Reject -> rejectDocument(reason) status updates

D) Certificates page
- List with filters: employee, course, date
- Create Certificate wizard
- Fake download button

E) Wallet Cards page
- List + preview component
- Must show training date + expiration date

F) Compliance page (minimal)
- Expiring soon list
- Expired list
- Simple filters only

G) Settings page
- Organization profile fields (mock)
- User profile fields (mock)
- Theme + language toggles repeated
- “Powered by: SyncAi”

H) Owner Admin
Owner Dashboard:
- organizations count
- users count (mock)
- open tickets
Owner Support:
- ticket table: category, organization, status, created date
- status dropdown: Open / In Progress / Resolved
- internal notes panel (add + view)
Categories exactly:
- Login / account issues
- Training records
- Certificate generation
- AI ingestion problems
- Billing questions
- Data corrections
- Feature requests

AUTH (Clickable prototype)
Use existing AuthContext if present. If it’s minimal, extend it:
- Login page includes two buttons:
  - “Sign in as Workspace User”
  - “Sign in as Owner Admin”
Store role in localStorage and route user accordingly:
- Workspace -> /dashboard
- Owner -> /owner/dashboard
Guard owner routes so workspace users can’t access them.

QUALITY GATES
- Every page clickable and navigable.
- No console errors.
- No untranslated text when Spanish selected.
- Keep copy short and simple.
- Add “Powered by: SyncAi” to header + footer.

DELIVERABLE OUTPUT
At the end, print:
1) list of files added/changed
2) how to test the main workflow:
   Documents -> review -> approve -> check dashboard updates + employee profile shows new certificate and wallet card
