Here’s an updated plan you can paste into Replit, with the new auth/login part added at the end 👇

Replace the existing plan with this (or paste this under it and trim):

Perfect! Now I have all the details I need. Let me create a comprehensive plan for your SafetySync.ai landing page with the exact GitHub-inspired dark theme, glassmorphic effects, and all the sections you specified.

App type
Modern web app
A stunning landing page for SafetySync.ai OSHA training compliance SaaS with GitHub-inspired dark theme and glassmorphic design.

I’ll include the following features:

Hero section with headline, dual CTAs, and glassmorphic app preview showing employee training status table

Problem/pain section with 4 glassmorphic cards highlighting spreadsheet chaos, lack of single source of truth, audit panic, and HR/safety misalignment

Features grid with 6 glassmorphic cards covering smart recordkeeping, automated expirations, instant certificates, HR+Safety workspace, OSHA 1910/1926 support, and audit-ready exports

For HR section with targeted copy and compliance stats dashboard (overall compliance %, overdue count, expiring soon count)

For training providers & consultants section explaining multi-client management capabilities

Testimonial/social proof section with quote about audit readiness and time savings

Compliance clarification section clearly stating recordkeeping vs. training content distinction

Pricing teaser with 3 tiers (Essential, Professional, Enterprise) with short descriptions and demo CTA

Final CTA section with strong closing message and footer with Privacy, Terms, Contact links

Sticky header with logo, navigation links (Features, For HR, Pricing, Login), and primary “Book a demo” CTA button

Complete GitHub-inspired dark theme with radial gradient background (blue ethereal glow from top-center)

All glassmorphic cards with exact specifications: backdrop-blur-xl, border-white/10, blue glow shadows, and elevation system

OSHA-orange gradient CTAs (from-orange-500 to-orange-600) with hover and active states

Responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

GlassCard component with all specified shadow effects and backdrop blur/saturation

PLUS: Authentication & Login Page Scaffolding (JWT-ready)

Build a dedicated /login page (and optional /signup or “create account” page) using the same GitHub-inspired dark theme and a prominent glassmorphic auth card centered on the screen.

The login page should include:

Email/username field

Password field

“Log in” CTA (OSHA-orange gradient button)

Optional “Forgot password?” link (can lead to a placeholder page for now)

Create a simple AuthContext (or similar React context + hook, e.g. useAuth) that will later be wired to a real backend, with:

user (or currentUser) state

token state

login(credentials) and logout() functions

Implement a placeholder auth service that simulates a JWT-based login flow for now:

login function that sends a POST to a configurable endpoint like /api/auth/login (URL and behavior can be mocked for now)

On “success”, store a fake JWT token (string) and basic user object in memory/localStorage and update AuthContext

Clearly mark this as a stub/TODO to be replaced with the real backend we are building later

Show how the app would use the auth state on the frontend:

The Login item in the header nav should link to the /login page

After a “successful” login (using the stub), redirect back to the main page or a placeholder “Dashboard” route that simply shows:

“You are logged in as {email}”

A Logout button that clears the auth state

Make sure the auth layout/components are clean and reusable, so we can later wire them directly to our real Node/Express backend and real JWTs without having to redesign the UI.

That tells Replit:

Keep building the dark landing page as planned ✅

Also scaffold JWT-ready login UI and auth context that you’ll wire up to your real backend later ✅

If you want, after Replit generates everything, I can help you:

Review the auth context it made, and

Adjust the token handling to match whatever backend routes we set up (/api/auth/login,
